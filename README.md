Using
---

The library and REST API are both based on the [OpenSocial Activity Streams service](https://opensocial.github.io/spec/2.0.1/Social-API-Server.xml#ActivityStreams-Service). Let's start with an example. This code using the library:

```python
from granary import twitter
...
tw = twitter.Twitter(ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)
tw.get_activities(group_id='@friends')
```

is equivalent to this `HTTP GET` request:

```
https://granary.io/twitter/@me/@friends/@app/
  ?access_token_key=ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY&access_token_secret=ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
```

They return the authenticated user's Twitter stream, ie tweets from the people they follow. Here's the JSON output:

```json
{
  "itemsPerPage": 10,
  "startIndex": 0,
  "totalResults": 12,
  "items": [{
      "verb": "post",
      "id": "tag:twitter.com,2013:374272979578150912",
      "url": "http://twitter.com/evanpro/status/374272979578150912",
      "content": "Getting stuff for barbecue tomorrow. No ribs left! Got some nice tenderloin though. (@ Metro Plus Famille Lemay) http://t.co/b2PLgiLJwP",
      "actor": {
      "username": "evanpro",
        "displayName": "Evan Prodromou",
        "description": "Prospector.",
        "url": "http://twitter.com/evanpro",
      },
      "object": {
        "tags": [{
            "url": "http://4sq.com/1cw5vf6",
            "startIndex": 113,
            "length": 22,
            "objectType": "article"
          }, "..."],
      },
    }, "..."]
  "..."
}
```

The request parameters are the same for both, all optional: `USER_ID` is a source-specific id or `@me` for the authenticated user. `GROUP_ID` may be `@all`, `@friends` (currently identical to `@all`), `@self`, `@search`, or `@blocks`; `APP_ID` is currently ignored; best practice is to use `@app` as a placeholder.

Paging is supported via the `startIndex` and `count` parameters. They're self explanatory, and described in detail in the [OpenSearch spec](http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1#The_.22count.22_parameter) and [OpenSocial spec](https://opensocial.github.io/spec/2.0.1/Social-API-Server.xml#ActivityStreams-Service).

When using the `GROUP_ID` `@search` (for platforms that support it â€” currently Twitter and Instagram), provide a search string via the `q` parameter. The API is loosely based on the [OpenSearch spec](http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1#OpenSearch_URL_template_syntax), the [OpenSocial Core Container spec](http://opensocial.github.io/spec/2.5.1/Core-Container.xml#rfc.section.11.2), and the [OpenSocial Core Gadget spec](http://opensocial.github.io/spec/2.5.1/Core-Gadget.xml#OpenSearch).

Output data is [JSON Activity Streams 1.0](http://activitystrea.ms/specs/json/1.0/) objects wrapped in the [OpenSocial envelope](https://opensocial.github.io/spec/2.0.1/Social-API-Server.xml#ActivityStreams-Service), which puts the activities in the top-level `items` field as a list and adds the `itemsPerPage`, `totalCount`, etc. fields.

Most Facebook requests and all Twitter, Instagram, and Flickr requests will need OAuth access tokens. If you're using Python on Google App Engine, [oauth-dropins](https://github.com/snarfed/oauth-dropins) is an easy way to add OAuth client flows for these sites. Otherwise, here are the sites' authentication docs: [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens/), [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/auth.oauth.html), [Instagram](http://instagram.com/developer/authentication/), [Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/3-legged-authorization).

If you get an access token and pass it along, it will be used to sign and authorize the underlying requests to the sources providers. See the demos on the REST API [endpoints above](#about) for examples.


Using the REST API
---

The [endpoints above](#about) all serve the [OpenSocial Activity Streams REST API](https://opensocial.github.io/spec/2.0.1/Social-API-Server.xml#ActivityStreams-Service). Request paths are of the form:

```
/USER_ID/GROUP_ID/APP_ID/ACTIVITY_ID?startIndex=...&count=...&format=FORMAT&access_token=...
```

All query parameters are optional. `FORMAT` may be `as1` (the default), `as2`, `atom`, `html`, `jsonfeed`, `mf2-json`, `rss`, or `xml` (the default). `atom` supports a boolean `reader` query parameter for toggling rendering appropriate to feed readers, e.g. location is rendered in content when `reader=true` (the default). The rest of the path elements and query params are [described above](#using).

Errors are returned with the appropriate HTTP response code, e.g. 403 for Unauthorized, with details in the response body.

By default, responses are cached and reused for 10m without re-fetching the source data. (Instagram responses are cached for 60m.) You can prevent this by adding the `cache=false` query parameter to your request.

Include the `shares=false` query parameter to omit shares, eg Twitter retweets, from the results.

To use the REST API in an existing ActivityStreams/ActivityPub client, you'll need to hard-code exceptions for the domains you want to use e.g. `facebook.com`, and redirect HTTP requests to the corresponding [endpoint above](#about).

Facebook and Instagram are disabled in the REST API entirely, sadly.


Using the library
---

See the [example above](#using) for a quick start guide.

Clone or download this repo into a directory named `granary`. Each source works the same way. Import the module for the source you want to use, then instantiate its class by passing the HTTP handler object. The handler should have a `request` attribute for the current HTTP request.

The useful methods are `get_activities()` and `get_actor()`, which returns the current authenticated user (if any). See the [full reference docs](https://granary.readthedocs.io/en/stable/source/granary.html#module-granary.source) for details. All return values are Python dicts of decoded ActivityStreams 1 JSON.

The `microformats2.*_to_html()` functions are also useful for rendering ActivityStreams 1 objects as nicely formatted HTML.


Troubleshooting/FAQ
---
Check out the [oauth-dropins Troubleshooting/FAQ section](https://github.com/snarfed/oauth-dropins#troubleshootingfaq). It's pretty comprehensive and applies to this project too.


Future work
---

We'd love to add more sites! Off the top of my head, [YouTube](http://youtu.be/), [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com/), [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/), [Sina Weibo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sina_Weibo), [Qzone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qzone), and [RenRen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renren) would be good candidates. If you're looking to get started, implementing a new site is a good place to start. It's pretty self contained and the existing sites are good examples to follow, but it's a decent amount of work, so you'll be familiar with the whole project by the end.


Development
---
Pull requests are welcome! Feel free to [ping me in #indieweb-dev](https://indieweb.org/discuss) with any questions.

First, fork and clone this repo. Then, install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) and run `gcloud components install cloud-firestore-emulator` to install the [Firestore emulator](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/emulator). Once you have them, set up your environment by running these commands in the repo root directory:

```shell
gcloud config set project granary-demo
python3 -m venv local
source local/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# needed to serve static files locally
ln -s local/lib/python3*/site-packages/oauth_dropins/static oauth_dropins_static
```

Now, run the tests to check that everything is set up ok:

```shell
gcloud emulators firestore start --host-port=:8089 --database-mode=datastore-mode < /dev/null >& /dev/null &
python3 -m unittest discover
```

Finally, run the web app locally with [`flask run`](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/cli/#run-the-development-server):

```shell
GAE_ENV=localdev FLASK_ENV=development flask run -p 8080
```

Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) and you should see the granary home page!

If you want to work on [oauth-dropins](https://github.com/snarfed/oauth-dropins) at the same time, install it in editable mode with `pip install -e <path to oauth-dropins repo>`. You'll also need to update the `oauth_dropins_static` symlink, which is needed for serving static file handlers locally: `ln -sf <path-to-oauth-dropins-repo>/oauth_dropins/static oauth_dropins_static`.

To deploy to production:

```shell
gcloud -q beta app deploy --no-cache granary-demo *.yaml
```

The docs are built with [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/), including [apidoc](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/man/sphinx-apidoc.html), [autodoc](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/autodoc.html), and [napoleon](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/napoleon.html). Configuration is in [`docs/conf.py`](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/blob/master/docs/conf.py) To build them, first install Sphinx with `pip install sphinx`. (You may want to do this outside your virtualenv; if so, you'll need to reconfigure it to see system packages with `virtualenv --system-site-packages local`.) Then, run [`docs/build.sh`](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/blob/master/docs/build.sh).


Release instructions
---
Here's how to package, test, and ship a new release. (Note that this is [largely duplicated in the oauth-dropins readme too](https://github.com/snarfed/oauth-dropins#release-instructions).)

1. Pull from remote to make sure we're at head.
    ```sh
    git checkout main
    git pull
    ```
1. Run the unit tests.
   ```sh
   source local/bin/activate.csh
   CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT=granary-demo gcloud emulators firestore start --host-port=:8089 --database-mode=datastore-mode < /dev/null >& /dev/null &
   sleep 5
   python -m unittest discover
   kill %1
   ```
1. Bump the version number in `setup.py` and `docs/conf.py`. `git grep` the old version number to make sure it only appears in the changelog. Change the current changelog entry in `README.md` for this new version from _unreleased_ to the current date.
1. Bump the `oauth-dropins` version specifier in `setup.py` to the most recent version.
1. Build the docs. If you added any new modules, add them to the appropriate file(s) in `docs/source/`. Then run `./docs/build.sh`. Check that the generated HTML looks fine by opening `docs/_build/html/index.html` and looking around.
1. `git commit -am 'release vX.Y'`
1. Upload to [test.pypi.org](https://test.pypi.org/) for testing.
   ```sh
   python setup.py clean build sdist
   setenv ver X.Y
   twine upload -r pypitest dist/granary-$ver.tar.gz
   ```
1. Install from test.pypi.org.
   ```sh
   cd /tmp
   python -m venv local
   source local/bin/activate.csh
   pip uninstall granary # make sure we force Pip to use the uploaded version
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install mf2py==1.1.2
   pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple granary==$ver
   ```
1. Smoke test that the code trivially loads and runs.
   ```sh
   python
   # run test code below
   ```
   Test code to paste into the interpreter:
   ```py
   import json
   from granary import github
   github.__file__  # check that it's in the virtualenv

   g = github.GitHub('XXX')  # insert a GitHub personal OAuth access token
   a = g.get_activities()
   print(json.dumps(a, indent=2))

   from granary import atom
   print(atom.activities_to_atom(a, {}))
   ```
1. Tag the release in git. In the tag message editor, delete the generated comments at bottom, leave the first line blank (to omit the release "title" in github), put `### Notable changes` on the second line, then copy and paste this version's changelog contents below it.
   ```sh
   git tag -a v$ver --cleanup=verbatim
   git push && git push --tags
   ```
1. [Click here to draft a new release on GitHub.](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/releases/new) Enter `vX.Y` in the _Tag version_ box. Leave _Release title_ empty. Copy `### Notable changes` and the changelog contents into the description text box.
1. Upload to [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/)!
   ```sh
   twine upload dist/granary-$ver.tar.gz
   ```
1. [Build the docs on Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/granary/builds/): first choose _latest_ in the drop-down, then click _Build Version_.
1. On the [Versions page](https://readthedocs.org/projects/granary/versions/), check that the new version is active, If it's not, activate it in the _Activate a Version_ section.

[Apache Streams](http://streams.incubator.apache.org/) is a similar project that translates between storage systems and database as well as social schemas. It's a Java library, and its design is heavily structured. [Here's the list of formats it supports.](http://streams.incubator.apache.org/site/0.3-incubating-SNAPSHOT/streams-project/streams-contrib/index.html) It's mainly used by [People Pattern](http://www.peoplepattern.com/).

[Gnip](http://gnip.com/) similarly [converts social network data to ActivityStreams](http://support.gnip.com/documentation/activity_streams_intro.html) and supports [many more source networks](http://gnip.com/sources/). Unfortunately, it's commercial, there's no free trial or self-serve signup, and [plans start at $500](http://gnip.com/products/pricing/).

[DataSift](http://datasift.com/) looks like broadly the same thing, except they offer [self-serve, pay as you go billing](http://dev.datasift.com/docs/billing), and they use [their own proprietary output format](http://dev.datasift.com/docs/getting-started/data) instead of ActivityStreams. They're also aimed more at data mining as opposed to individual user access.

[Cliqset's FeedProxy](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/cliqset_activity_streams_api.php) used to do this kind of format translation, but unfortunately it and Cliqset died.

Facebook [used to](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/225/) [officially](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2009/08/05/streamlining-the-open-stream-apis/) [support](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/activity-streams/-b0LmeUExXY) ActivityStreams, but that's also dead.

There are a number of products that download your social network data, normalize it, and let you query and visualize it. [SocialSafe](http://socialsafe.net/) is one, although the SSL certificate is currently out of date. [ThinkUp](http://web.archive.org/web/20161108212106/http://www.thinkup.com/) was an open source product, but shuttered on 18 July 2016. There's also the lifelogging/lifestream aggregator vein of projects that pull data from multiple source sites. [Storytlr](https://github.com/storytlr/storytlr) is a good example. It doesn't include Facebook, or Instagram, but does include a number of smaller source sites. There are lots of others, e.g. the [Lifestream WordPress plugin](http://www.enthropia.com/labs/wp-lifestream/). Unfortunately, these are generally aimed at end users, not developers, and don't usually expose libraries or REST APIs.

On the open source side, there are many related projects. [php-mf2-shim](https://github.com/indieweb/php-mf2-shim) adds [microformats2](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2) to Facebook and Twitter's raw HTML. [sockethub](https://github.com/sockethub/sockethub) is a similar "polyglot" approach, but more focused on writing than reading.


Changelog

  * Convert pinned posts (just one per actor) between Bluesky's `pinnedPost` field and the fediverse's `featured` collection.
  * Switch `getFollows`/`getFollowers` calls from PDS to AppView. (These requests to Bluesky PDSes were timing out connection from Google Cloud IPs as of 2025-05-08.)
  * `from_as1`:
    * If `content` is in a [language that doesn't delimit words by spaces](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Writing_systems_without_word_boundaries), truncate between any characters ([snarfed/bridgy-fed#1625](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1625)).
    * Bug fix: handle bare string `image`.
    * Bug fix for when last line of content is a bsky.app URL that's not a post ([bridgy-fed#2064](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/2064)).

    * Better error handling when embed record `$type` is invalid.
  * `web_url_to_at_uri` and `BSKY_APP_URL_RE`: tighten validation, check authority and rkey for allowed characters.
* `mastodon`:
  * Convert `followers_count`/`following_count` in Mastodon accounts to the non-standard `followers` and `following` AS1 collections (borrowed from ActivityPub).

  * `to_as1`:
    * Bug fix: handle `u-bookmark-of h-cite` ([#918](github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/918)).
    * Only populate `u-url` into `url` if it's a valid URL.
* `nostr`:
  * Add new `nip05_to_npub` function to resolve [NIP-05](https://nips.nostr.com/5) identifiers.
  * Add new `bech32_decode`, `bech32_encode`, `bech32_prefix_for`, `pubkey_from_privkey`, `uri_for` functions.

    * When converting `created_at` to `published`, include UTC timezone.
    * When converting actors to kind 0 Nostr events, remove unset fields from content instead of setting them to null, and only use `_` NIP-05 username with full domains.
    * Don't escape Unicode characters ([background](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/issues/354)).
    * Convert HTML `content` to Markdown plain text.
  * `Nostr`:
    * Add new `user_url` method.
    * Add optional new `privkey` kwarg to constructor to sign events with; remove `pubkey` kwarg.
    * `create` now signs activities before sending to relays. Now requires the `privkey` member attribute to be set.
    * `query`:
      * Verify signatures; discard events with invalid signatures.
      * Add [NIP-42](https://nips.nostr.com/42) support; reply to `AUTH` challenges with signatures from the stored `privkey`.

### 8.0 - 2025-01-01

_Breaking changes:_

* `as2`:
  * `from_as1`: In `Link` objects (including `Tag`s and `Mention`s), convert `url` to `href`. Before this, we left it as `url`, which was incorrect AS2.

_Non-breaking changes:_

Standardize function and method names in all modules to `to_as1`, `from_as`, etc. Old method names are now deprecated but won't be removed until at least v9.0, if not later.

* `as1`:

* `as2`:
  * Add support for the `Application`, `Block`, `Flag`, and `Link` types.
  * Generalize actor logic in `to/from_as1` across all actor types, not just `Person`.

    * Add support for:
      * `app.bsky.embed.record`
      * `app.bsky.embed.recordWithMedia`

    * Add `value` boolean kwarg.
    * Change `client` kwarg from `Bluesky` to `lexrpc.Client`.

  * Raise `requests.HTTPError` with `response.status_code` 502 instead of `JSONDecodeError` on non-JSON responses. This is synthetic, but more helpful for error handling.
* microformats2:
  * `object_to_json` and related functions: handle all escaped HTML entities, not just `&amp;` `&lt;` `&gt;`.
  * Unify `microformats2.prefix_image_urls` and `prefix_video_urls` into a new `as1.prefix_urls` function.
* RSS:
  * Remove `itunes:category`. It has to be [one of Apple's explicit categories](https://feedgen.kiesow.be/ext/api.ext.podcast.html#feedgen.ext.podcast.PodcastExtension.itunes_category), which we aren't prepared to validate, so don't try.
* ActivityStreams 2:
  * Translate both `url` and `urls` from AS1 into multi-valued AS2 `url` field.
* Move a number of utility methods from the `Source` class to a new `as1` module: `object_type`, `merge_by_id`, `is_public`, `add_rsvps_to_event`, `get_rsvps_from_event`, `activity_changed`, `append_in_reply_to`, `actor_name`, `original_post_discovery`.
* `as1.original_post_discovery`: remove deprecated `cache` kwarg.

_Non-breaking changes:_

* ActivityStreams 2:
  * Fix spec compliance bug: [`icon` and `image` are singly valued, not multiply valued](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-icon).
  * Add new `is_public` method and `PUBLIC_AUDIENCE` constant.
  * Prefer `"objectType": "featured"` first in the `image` field when converting from AS1, last in the `icon` field. This matches the ActivityPub (Mastodon) convention of using `icon` for profile pictures and `image` for header images.
  * Propagate `url` values into new `PropertyValue` attachments on `Person` objects; these end up in Mastodon's "profile metadata" link fields.
  * `to_as1`: if an attachment's `mediaType` is `image/...`, override `objectType` and set it to `image`.
* Twitter
  * Trim alt text in line between post preview and creation
  * Correctly trim Twitter alt text
* Facebook
  * Scraping: extract post id and owner id from `data-ft` attribute and `_ft_` query param more often instead of `story_fbid`, which is now an opaque token that changes regularly. ([facebook-atom#27](https://github.com/snarfed/facebook-atom/issues/27))
* Instagram
  * Add new `Instagram.scraped_json_to_activities` method.
* GitHub
  * `create` and `preview`: convert profile URLs to @-mentions, eg `https://github.com/snarfed` to `@snarfed` ([bridgy#1090](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/1090)).
    * `get_activities` with `activity_id` now supports `fetch_replies` and `fetch_likes`.
* Reddit
  * Add `cache` support to `get_activities`.
* REST API
  * Add new `/scraped` endpoint that accepts `POST` requests with silo HTML as input. Currently only supports Instagram. Requires `site=instagram`, `output=...` (any supported output format), and HTML as either raw request body or MIME multipart encoded file in the `input` parameter.
* microformats2
  * Add new `extra` and `body_class` kwargs to `activities_to_html`.
  * When converting `u-featured` images to AS1, add new non-standard `"objectType": "featured"` field to distinguish them from `u-photo`.
  * Convert `p-note` to AS1 `summary`.
  * Bug fixes for converting `image` attachments to `photo`.
* `Source.original_post_discovery`: add new `max_redirect_fetches` keyword arg.

### 4.0 - 2022-03-23

_Breaking changes:_

* Drop Python 3.5 support. Python 3.6 is now the minimum required version.

_Non-breaking changes:_

* RSS:
  * Add support for RSS input via new `rss.to_activities` function.
* Add new `include_shares` kwarg to `get_activities`, implemented for Twitter and Mastodon. Defaults to `True`. If `False`, shares (retweets in Twitter, boosts in Mastodon) will be discarded and not returned. Also add a corresponding `shares` query param to the REST API.
* Instagram (scraping):
  * Handle media items with no `user` object, add new fetch for comments.
  * Add `Instagram.merge_scraped_comments()`.
* ActivityStreams 2:
  * Handle error when `type` isn't a string.
* Reddit:
  * Implement `get_activities()` to fetch posts by the current user or a user specified with `user_id`.
* Facebook scraping:

  * Miscellaneous bug fixes.
* JSONFeed:
  * Handle malformed `items.author` element.

### 3.2 - 2021-09-15
* `Source.original_post_discovery`: add new `include_reserved_hosts` kwarg, defaults to `True`.
* Instagram:
  * Update scraping to handle new `feed_v2` JSON format.
* Facebook:
  * Scraping: handle pictures, videos, link attachments, and text links in timeline/news feed posts.
* Mastodon:
  * Bug fix for `get_activities()` with `fetch_mentions=True`: handle notifications with `status: null`. Maybe happens when a status is deleted?
  * `create`/`preview_create`: support bookmarks. (Nothing special happens with them; their `content` is posted as a normal toot.)
* microformats2:
  * Stop rendering `image.displayName` as visible text in HTML, since it's already in the `<img>`'s `alt` attribute.
  * Add [`bookmark-of`](https://indieweb.org/bookmark#How_to_markup) support.
  * Add `prefix_image_urls()` function.
  * Handle null `content` in AS1/2 objects.
  * `json_to_object` bug fix for composite `bookmark-of` properties.
* Twitter:
  * `create`/`preview`: [support large videos](https://twittercommunity.com/t/large-file-can-not-be-finalized-synchronously/82929/3) via async upload. We now pass `media_category=tweet_video` to the chunked upload `INIT` stage, and then make blocking `STATUS` calls until the video is finished processing. ([bridgy#1043](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/1043))
  * `create`/`preview`: allow bookmarks. ([bridgy#1045](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/1045))
  * `create`/`preview`: allow non-Twitter replies, ie activities that include `inReplyTo` URLs even if none of them point to a tweet. ([bridgy#1063](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/1063))
  * `get_activities`: support list ids as well as slugs.
  * Bug fixes for removing t.co links to quoted tweets.
  * Bug fix for multiple instances of the same link in tweet text.
  * `get_activities()`: raise `ValueError` on invalid `user_id`.
* REST API: ported web framework from webapp2 to Flask. No user-visible behavior change expected.

### 3.1 - 2021-04-03

* Add Python 3.8 support, drop 3.3 and 3.4. Python 3.5 is now the minimum required version.
* Add [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/)! Heavily based on Mastodon.
* Standardize Instagram's and Facebook's scraping into new common `scraped_to_activities()`, `scraped_to_activity()`, and `merge_scraped_reactions()` methods.
* Atom:
  * Add the `summary` element ([#157](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/157)).
* REST API:
  * Bug fix: URL-encode Unicode characters in `Link` HTTP headers (eg `rel=self`, `rel=header`).
* Facebook:
  * Scraping now uses [mbasic.facebook.com](https://mbasic.facebook.com/) instead of [m.facebook.com](https://m.facebook.com/).
* Flickr:
  * Add support for adding tags to existing photos ([bridgy#857](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/857)).
  * `get_comment()`: skip fetching comments from API if `activity` kwarg is provided and contains the requested comment.
* GitHub:
  * Handle [HTTP 451 Unavailable for Legal Reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_451) responses ([eg for DMCA takedowns](https://developer.github.com/changes/2016-03-17-the-451-status-code-is-now-supported/)) gracefully.
  * Add create/preview support for reactions on pull review request comments (ie URLs with `#discussion_r...` fragments).
* HTML/microformats2:
  * Add `aria-hidden="true"` to empty links ([bridgy#947](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/947)).
  * Bug fix: escape `&`, `<`, and `>` characters in bare mf2 `content` properties ([aaronpk/XRay#102](https://github.com/aaronpk/XRay/issues/102)).
  * `json_to_object()`: convert `nickname` to `username`.
* JSON Feed:
  * Gracefully handle when `content_html` and `content_text` are [incorrectly](https://jsonfeed.org/version/1#items) lists instead of strings.
* Instagram:
  * Include threaded (ie nested) comments in scraping ([bridgy#958](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/958)).
* Mastodon:
  * Bug fix for alt text with image attachments ([bridgy#975](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/975)).
  * Omit empty `limit` param [for compatibility with Pleroma](https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma/-/issues/2198) ([bridgy#977](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/977)).
* Meetup:
  * `create()`: handle API errors and return the error message in the `CreationResult` ([bridgy#921](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/921)).
* Twitter:
  * Bug fix: URL-encode list names in API calls.
  * Bug fix: propagate alt text into AS1 `photo.displayName` so that it gets all the way into microformats2 JSON and HTML ([#183](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/183)).
* Reddit:
  * Implement `post_id()`.
  * Cache user data fetched from the API for 5m to avoid repeating user profile API requests ([bridgy#1021](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/1021)).
    when fetching multiple comments or posts from the same author
  * Bug fix: use 'displayName' instead of 'name' in AS1 objects for submissions.
  * Bug fix: use tag URIs for activity ids.
* ActivityStreams 2:
  * `to_as1()`: for `Create` activities, include the activity actor's data in the object's author ([snarfed/bridgy-fed#75](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/75)).
  * `to_as1()`: convert `preferredUsername` to `username`.
  * `from_as1()`: convert `username` to `preferredUsername`.
  * `from_as1()`: bug fix, make `context` kwarg actually work.

### 3.0 - 2020-04-08

_Breaking changes:_

* _Python 2 is no longer supported!_ Including the [App Engine Standard Python 2 runtime](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/). On the plus side, the [Python 3 runtime](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/) is now supported! See this [list of differences](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/python-differences) for more details.

Non-breaking changes:

* Migrate demo app and API to the App Engine Standard Python 3 runtime.
* Instagram:
  * Scraping: fetch 50 likes instead of 24. ([snarfed/bridgy#898](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/898))
  * Scraping bug fix for `get_actor()` with `user_id`.
* Twitter:
  * Add [image alt text](https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/a/2016/alt-text-support-for-twitter-cards-and-the-rest-api.html) support to `get_activites()` etc ([#183](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/183)).
* RSS:
  * Add `itunes:image`, `itunes:author`, and `itunes:category`.
  * Strip HTML from `title` element ([#177](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/177)). [Background.](https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/warning/ContainsHTML.html)
  * Always include author in items ([#177](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/177)).
  * Bug fix: extract feed image from `hfeed` correctly.

* Atom:
  * Bug fix: extract feed image from `hfeed` correctly.
* REST API:
  * Add HTTP `HEAD` support.
  * Add support for URL fragments with `input=html`. If a fragment is provided, only that specific element is extracted and converted. ([#185](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/185))
* GitHub:
  * Publish: preserve `<code>` tags instead of converting them to \`s so that GitHub renders HTML entities like `&gt;` inside them instead of leaving them escaped. [Background.](https://chat.indieweb.org/dev/2019-12-24#t1577174464779200)
* JSON Feed:
  * Handle malformed attachments better.
* microformats2:
  * Don't crash on string `context` fields.
  * `html_to_activities()`: limit to `h-entry`, `h-event`, and `h-cite` items ([#192](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/192)).
* The `cache` kwarg to `Source.original_post_discovery()` now has no effect. `webutil.util.follow_redirects()` has its own built in caching now.
* Added Meetup.com support for publishing RSVPs.

### 2.2 - 2019-11-02
* Add Mastodon support!
* Add Python 3.7 support, and improve overall Python 3 compatibility.
* Update a number of dependencies.
* Switch from Python's built in `json` module to [`ujson`](https://github.com/esnme/ultrajson/) to speed up JSON parsing and encoding.
* Add `duration` and `size` support to ActivityStreams 1 and 2, RSS, and microformats2 HTML and JSON. [microformats2 support is still emerging for both](https://indieweb.org/podcast#Brainstorming). Both integer seconds and [ISO 8601 string durations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations) are supported for `duration`. Integer bytes is used for `size` everywhere. microformats2 HTML also includes human-readable strings, eg `5.1 MB`. ([#169](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/169))
* Twitter:
  * `[preview]_create()`: detect attempts to upload [images over 5MB](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/media/upload-media/uploading-media/media-best-practices#image-specs) and return an error.
* Facebook:
  * Add `get_activities(scrape=True)` for scraping HTML from [m.facebook.com](https://m.facebook.com/). Requires `c_user` and `xs` cookies from a logged in session ([snarfed/bridgy#886](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/886)).
  * [Upgrade Graph API version from 2.10 to 4.0.](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/changelog)
* Atom:
  * Bug fix for de-duping images in attachments.
* RSS:
  * Wrap all `<description>` element contents in `CDATA` sections.
  * Render images in `<description>` with HTML `<img>` tags ([#175](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/175)).
  * `from_activities()` bug fix: don't crash when converting multiple attachments to enclosures in a single item. (RSS only supports one enclosure per item, so we now only include the first, and log a warning if the activity has more.)

### 2.1 - 2019-09-04
* Convert AS2 `Mention` tags to AS1 `objectType` `mention` (non-standard) and vice versa ([snarfed/bridgy-fed#46](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/46)).
* Twitter:
  * Bug fix for large block list fetches that get rate limited after a few successful requests.
  * Handle HTTP 403 + error code 200 when fetching retweets for a protected or otherwise unavailable tweet ([bridgy#688](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/688#issuecomment-520600329)).
  * Demote @-mentions from [person-tags](https://indieweb.org/person-tag) to [mentions](https://indieweb.org/mention). Specifically, this means they'll no longer get rendered with `u-category` mf2.
* Instagram:
  * Disabled in the REST API entirely due to Instagram's aggressive rate limiting and blocking ([bridgy#655](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/665#issuecomment-524977427)).
  * Update scraping to handle replies in new `edge_media_to_parent_comment` field ([#164](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/164)).
  * Use cookie for all scraping HTTP requests, not just for likes.
* microformats2:
  * Revise whitespace handling; use `white-space: pre` CSS in HTML output.
* Facebook:
  * Bug fix: don't interpret `photo.php` as username in post URLs.
* Atom:
  * Switch from `white-space: pre` CSS back to converting newlines to `<br>`s because some feed readers ([eg NewsBlur](https://forum.newsblur.com/t/android-cant-read-line-pre-formatted-lines/6116)) follow it too strictly and don't even line wrap.
* RSS:
  * Default title to ellipsized content.

### 2.0 - 2019-03-01

_Breaking change_: drop Google+ since [it shuts down in March](https://developers.google.com/+/api-shutdown). Notably, this removes the `googleplus` module.

### 1.15 - 2019-02-28

* Atom:
  * Bug fix for actors and attachments with multiple image URLs.
  * Bug fix for attachment author objects with no properties.
* Google+:
  * Drop from web UI and REST API since [consumer Google+ is shutting down entirely](https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/expediting-changes-google-plus/) ([more](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/846)).
  * Switch from deprecated global API endpoint to G+ endpoint. Background in [snarfed/bridgy#846](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/846), [Google blog post](https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/03/discontinuing-support-for-json-rpc-and.html) [and docs](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/guide/batch).
* Instagram:
  * Fix individual photo/video link urls for multi-photo/video posts.
  * Handle [user-provided alt text](https://instagram-press.com/blog/2018/11/28/creating-a-more-accessible-instagram/) ([#159](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/159)).
* Twitter:
  * Update max video upload size from 5MB to 512MB ([#162](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/162)).
* `/url`: Return HTTP 400 when fetching the user's URL results in an infinite redirect.

### 1.14 - 2018-11-12
Add `delete()`. Currently includes Twitter and Flickr support.
* Instagram:
  * Make extra HTTP fetch (with cookie) to get individual likes ([snarfed/bridgy#840](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/840)).
  * Update scraping logic to handle feed HTML changes.
  * Link @-mentions in comments as well as photo/video captions.
* GitHub:

* Flickr:
  * Add `delete()` and `preview_delete()` for deleting photos.
* microformats2:
  * Add [follow-of](https://indieweb.org/follow) support.
  * Only use quotation-of property for quote tweets, not URLs. ([#155](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/155))
  * If a tag has startIndex/length, it gets linkified in the content, so don't also emit an mf2 child or HTML h-cite for it. ([#155](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/155)
* Atom:
  * Encode `&`s in author URL and email address too. (Thanks [sebsued](https://twitter.com/sebsued)!)
* AS2:
  * Add `Follow` support.

### 1.13 - 2018-08-08
* Twitter:
  * Support ISO 8601 formatted created_at timestamps, which the [archive download uses](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-twitter-archive), as well as RFC 2822 from the API.
  * `create()` and `preview_create()`: support RSVPs. Tweet them as normal tweets with the RSVP content. ([snarfed/bridgy#818](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/818))
  * `create()` and `preview_create()`: support alt text for images, via AS1 `displayName`. ([snarfed/bridgy#756](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/756)).
* Instagram:
  * Add global rate limiting lock for scraping. If a scraping HTTP request gets a 429 or 503 response, we refuse to make more requests for 5m, and instead short circuit and return the same error. This can be overridden with a new `ignore_rate_limit` kwarg to `get_activities()`.
* GitHub:
  * Add `tag` support to `create`/`preview_create` to add label(s) to existing issues ([snarfed/bridgy#811](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/811)).
  * Escape HTML characters (`<`, `>`, and `&`) in content in `create()` and `preview_create()` ([snarfed/bridgy#810](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/810)).
  * `get_activities()` and `get_comment()` now return `ValueError` instead of `AssertionError` on malformed `activity_id` and `comment_id` args, respectively.
  * `get_activities()` bug fix for issues/PRs with no body text.
  * Switch from GraphQL to REST API for creating comments and reactions, since GraphQL hits authorization errors on many org repos. ([snarfed/bridgy#824](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/824))
  * Improve GraphQL support for comments and users.
* Atom:
  * Shorten and ellipsize feed title when necessary ([#144](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/144)).
* microformats2:
  * Upgrade mf2py to improve a few things like [implied p-name detection](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2-implied-properties) and whitespace handling ([#142](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/142), fixes [#145](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/145), [snarfed/bridgy#756](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/756), [snarfed/bridgy#828](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/828)).
  * Support `alt` attribute in `<img>` tags ([snarfed/bridgy#756](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/756)).

### 1.12 - 2018-03-24
* Add Python 3 support! Granary now requires either Python 2.7+ or Python 3.3+.
* Instagram:
  * Fix scraping profile pages.
* Twitter:
  * Update character counting to handle Twitter change that now auto-links *all* ccTLDs. [Background.](https://github.com/kylewm/brevity/issues/8)
* GitHub:
  * Bug fix for `get_activities()` with deleted issues and repos.
* microformats2:
  * `object_to_json()`: convert tags to simple strings in the `category` property, not full nested objects like `h-card`s ([#141](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/141)).
  * Special case GitHub issues that are in-reply-to a repo or its `/issues` URL to be objectType `issue`.
  * Render simple string categories in HTML output.

This release is intentionally small and limited in scope to contain any impact of the Python 3 migration. It *should* be a noop for existing Python 2 users, and we've tested thoroughly, but I'm sure there are still bugs. Please file issues if you notice anything broken!

### 1.11 - 2018-03-09
* Add GitHub!
  * `get_activities()` supports issues and pull requests, including comments and reactions. It's currently based on notifications, so it's best effort, not comprehensive, and only includes recently active issues/PRs.
  * `create()` and `preview_create()` support issues, comments, [stars](https://help.github.com/articles/about-stars), and [reactions](https://help.github.com/articles/about-conversations-on-github/#reacting-to-ideas-in-comments).
* Twitter:
  * Prefer MP4 and other video/... content types to HLS (.m3u8) etc. [Background.](https://twittercommunity.com/t/retiring-mp4-video-output/66093)
  * Prefer HTTPS URLs for media images.
  * `get_activities()`: Support @-prefixed usernames in `user_id`.
* Facebook:
  * Support new [recurring aka multi-instance events](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45131646/decoding-recurring-events-from-facebook-open-graph-api). `create()` and `preview_create()` now only support RSVPs to individual instances of multi-instance events, to match the Facebook API itself.
  * Try harder to find original (full) sized photo URLs, specifically `_o.jpg` files instead of `_s.jpg`.
  * `create()` bug fix for photo and image URLs with unicode characters.
  * Fixed bug where `get_activities(user_id=...)` included the authenticated user's own recent photos, albums, and news publishes.
* Instagram:
  * Extract more user (`author`) data from scraped profile pages.
  * Fix home page feed scraping.
* microformats2, Atom:
  * Add enclosures for image attachments.
  * Bug fixes for rendering image, video, and audio attachments inside shares and attachments. De-dupe images.
* microformats2:
  * Handle simple string-only author properties.
  * Add `fetch_mf2` kwarg to `json_to_object()` for fetching additional pages over HTTP to determine authorship.
  * Generate explicit blank `p-name` in HTML to prevent old flawed [implied p-name handling](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2-implied-properties) ([#131](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/131)).
  * Fix `share` verb handling in `activity_to_json()` and `activities_to_html()` ([#134](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/134)).
  * Remember which content contains HTML, preserve newlines in it, and don't translate those newlines to `<br>`s ([#130](https://github.com/snarfed/granary/issues/130)).
* Atom:
  * Fix timezone bugs in `updated` and `published`.
* JSON Feed:
  * Omit title from items if it's the same as the content. (Often caused by microformats2's implied `p-name` logic.)

### 1.10 - 2017-12-10
* Moved web site and REST API to [granary.io](https://granary.io/)! [granary-demo.appspot.com](https://granary-demo.appspot.com/) now 301 redirects.
* Twitter:
  * Update the publish character limit to 280. [Background.](https://twittercommunity.com/t/updating-the-character-limit-and-the-twitter-text-library/96425)
  * Fix a [bug in preview_create that auto-linked @-mentions inside URLs](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/527#issuecomment-346302800), e.g. Medium posts.
  * Support videos and animated GIFs in `get_activities()` etc.

### 1.9 - 2017-10-24

* Add [ActivityStreams 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/)! New `as2` module includes `to_as1()` and `from_as1()` functions. Currently supported: articles, notes, replies, likes, reposts, events, RSVPs, tags, attachments.

* microformats2:
    * Add [`u-featured`](https://indieweb.org/featured) to ActivityStreams `image`.
    * Improve `h-event` support.
    * Minor whitespace change (added <p>) when rendering locations as HTML.

    * Interpret h-cite and [u-quotation-of](https://indieweb.org/quotation#How_to_markup) (experimental) as attachments, e.g. for quote tweets.
    * Convert [audio](http://indieweb.org/audio) and [video](http://indieweb.org/video) properties to AS attachments.
* Twitter:
    * Linkify @-mentions and hashtags in `preview_create()`.

### 1.6 - 2016-11-26
* Twitter:
    * Handle new "extended" tweets with hidden reply-to @-mentions and trailing
    URLs for media, quote tweets, etc. Background:
    https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/upcoming-changes-to-tweets
    * Bug fix: ensure like.author.displayName is a plain unicode string so that it
    can be pickled normally, e.g. by App Engine's memcache.
    * Bug fix: handle names with emoji correctly in favorites_html_to_likes().
    * Bug fix: handle search queries with unicode characters.
* Atom:
    * Render full original quoted tweet in retweets of quote tweets.
* microformats2 HTML:
    * Optionally follow and fetch rel="author" links.
    * Improve mapping between microformats2 and ActivityStreams 'photo' types. (mf2 'photo' type is a note or article *with* a photo, but AS 'photo' type *is* a photo. So, map mf2 photos to underlying type without photo.)
    * Support location properties beyond h-card, e.g. h-adr, h-geo, u-geo, and even
    when properties like latitude and longitude appear at the top level.
* Error handling: return HTTP 502 for non-JSON API responses, 504 for connection failures.

### 1.5 - 2016-08-25

    vs real name vs path alias. This specifically detects when a user name is
    probably actually a real name because it has a space.
    * Uploading: detect and handle App Engine's 10MB HTTP request limit.
    * Bug fix in create: handle unicode characters in photo/video description,
    hashtags, and comment text.
* Atom:
    * Bug fix: escape &s in attachments' text (e.g. quote tweets).
    * Bug fix: handle multiply valued 'object' fields in ActivityStreams 1 activities.
